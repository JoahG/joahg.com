Dearest Haley,
My love for you is greater than you could ever imagine. 
Calculating its measure is like dividing by zero, or doubling the computing value of Infinity.
From the day I met you, I have noticed a certain uniqueness in the way you communicate.
We met around a bowl of popcorn at the Coveys' house (on 7/29/10).
The first joke you told me was about how you could jump out of a 15-story building (out the front door) and live.
Ever since then, I have had a growing interest in you and your habits.
You convinced me pork was bad for me, enough for me to give up bacon.
You fueled my passion for programming with your own, and gave me a reason to learn more.
You kept the competitive edge on me enough for me to persevere in gaining copious amounts of information that I likely wouldn't have otherwise.
You have challenged me, pushed me, and frustrated me (in a good way ;)).
I am inspired by your incredible eye for design, and I can't wait to work with you more in the future.
You are beautiful, but not entirely externally - you wonderfully display God's love and faithfulness.
You are comically witty and sarcastic, while at the same time maintaining an admirable level of humility.
Your love for those younger for you is amazing, and you seem to be on the way to being a spectacular mother someday.
Your readiness to forgive is a quality that I strive to match, for you have given me far greater forgiveness than I deserve.
You are the CSS to my HTML, the beautiful overlay over my ghastly markup.
I can't wait to see what the future holds :).
-(9x-7i)>-3(3x-7u).
Love, your Joah.
